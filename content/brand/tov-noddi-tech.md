## 1. Core Voice Pillars

| Pillar | What It Means | Example |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| **Intelligent Confidence** | Speak like the product has already changed the industry. | "No syncing. No chaos. Just one platform." |
| **Design-Led Simplicity** | Every word earns its space. Short, intentional sentences. | "Built for speed. Designed for people." |
| **Operational Directness** | Focus on what customers gain, not what we've built. | "Cut admin time by 30%. Serve more customers." |
| **Nordic Sass** | Precision with personality â€” witty in a calm way. | "If it feels like magic, it's just good logic." |

## 2. Voice in Practice

### âœ… Do

- Use declarative statements: "It works." not "It helps you work better."
- Write for listening. Read it out loud â€” it should sound natural.
- Keep paragraphs under three lines.
- End sections with conviction, not apology.

### ðŸš« Don't

- Use corporate fluff: "comprehensive solutions", "cutting-edge", "innovation".
- Over-explain features â€” show outcomes.
- Use jargon or internal phrases ("backend API connectors").
- Add exclamation marks â€” confidence doesn't shout.
