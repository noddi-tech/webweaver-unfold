## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "I can't find the AI Translate button"
- Make sure you're logged in
- Go to `/cms/translations` directly
- Look for "Translate" or "AI" in the UI
- Check the top right corner or action buttons

### "AI Translation isn't working"
**Check**:
- LOVABLE_API_KEY secret is configured (it is ‚úÖ)
- You have approved English translations (371 approved ‚úÖ)
- Languages are enabled in Language Settings

**Solution**:
- Try translating one language at a time
- Check edge function logs in Supabase
- Ensure you have internet connectivity

### "Translations show in English even on /de/"
**This is normal IF**:
- You haven't run AI translation yet
- Fallback system shows English when no translation exists
- This is by design!

**Solution**: Run AI translation

### "Layout breaks with long German text"
**German is ~30% longer than English**

**Quick fixes**:
```css
/* Add to affected components */
.text-container {
  overflow-wrap: break-word;
  word-break: break-word;
}
```

**Better solution**:
- Review German translation
- Use shorter alternatives where possible
- Adjust component styling

### "Language switcher not showing"
**Check**:
- Language Settings ‚Üí Show language switcher in header (should be ON)
- At least 2 languages are enabled
- You're not on `/cms` routes (CMS doesn't show language switcher)

**Test on**: `/en/` or `/de/` (not `/cms`)
