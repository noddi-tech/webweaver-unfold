## üîÑ Phase 8: Testing & Verification

Use this section to verify the system is working:

### Database Tests

- [ ] Verify translations exist:
  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*), language_code FROM translations GROUP BY language_code;
  ```
- [ ] Check translation stats:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM translation_stats ORDER BY code;
  ```
- [ ] Verify language settings:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM language_settings;
  ```

### UI Tests

- [ ] Visit homepage in English: `/en/`
- [ ] Visit homepage in Norwegian: `/no/`
- [ ] Switch languages using header switcher
- [ ] Switch languages using footer switcher
- [ ] Verify Hero section displays translated content
- [ ] Click navigation links and verify language persists
- [ ] Test on mobile (language switcher should work)

### Translation Manager Tests

- [ ] Access `/cms/translations` (requires login)
- [ ] View translations for different languages
- [ ] Search for translation keys
- [ ] Edit a translation
- [ ] Add a new translation key
- [ ] Run "AI Translate All Languages"
- [ ] Approve/reject translations
- [ ] Verify statistics update correctly

### Console Tests

- [ ] Check browser console for i18n logs
- [ ] Verify no translation errors
- [ ] Confirm translations load message appears
- [ ] Test real-time updates (change translation in DB, see update)

## üìã Adding Translations to New Components

When adding translations to a new component:

1. **Import the hook:**
   ```typescript
   import { useAppTranslation } from '@/hooks/useAppTranslation';
   ```

2. **Use in component:**
   ```typescript
   const { t } = useAppTranslation();
   return <h1>{t('section.key', 'Fallback text')}</h1>;
   ```

3. **Add translation keys:**
   - Option A: Via UI at `/cms/translations`
   - Option B: Via migration:
     ```sql
     INSERT INTO translations (translation_key, language_code, translated_text, approved, page_location) 
     VALUES ('section.key', 'en', 'English text', true, 'page-name')
     ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;
     ```

4. **Use LanguageLink for internal links:**
   ```typescript
   import { LanguageLink } from '@/components/LanguageLink';
   <LanguageLink to="/path">Link Text</LanguageLink>
   ```

5. **Test in multiple languages:**
   - Switch to different languages
   - Verify text displays correctly
   - Check for layout issues with longer translations

## üöÄ Production Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] All critical pages have translations
- [ ] English translations are approved
- [ ] At least 2-3 languages fully translated
- [ ] AI translation has been run
- [ ] All translations reviewed and approved
- [ ] Language detection tested on different devices
- [ ] SEO meta tags updated for each language
- [ ] `sitemap.xml` includes language-specific URLs
- [ ] Analytics configured to track language usage
- [ ] Error messages translated
- [ ] Form validation messages translated
- [ ] Email templates support multiple languages (if applicable)

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Translations not appearing

**Solution:**
1. Check if translation exists: `SELECT * FROM translations WHERE translation_key = 'your.key'`
2. Verify translation is approved: `approved = true`
3. Check console for loading errors
4. Clear browser cache and reload

### Issue: Language not switching

**Solution:**
1. Check URL includes language prefix (e.g., `/en/` not just `/`)
2. Verify `LanguageSync` wrapper is used in route
3. Check language is enabled in `languages` table
4. Clear localStorage `noddi-language` key

### Issue: AI translation not working

**Solution:**
1. Check `LOVABLE_API_KEY` is set in Supabase secrets
2. Verify English translations are approved
3. Check edge function logs for errors
4. Test edge function directly via Supabase dashboard

### Issue: Real-time updates not working

**Solution:**
1. Check Supabase Realtime is enabled on project
2. Verify subscription is active (check console)
3. Check browser supports WebSockets
4. Reload page to establish new connection

## üìä Monitoring

Track these metrics:

- [ ] Number of translations per language
- [ ] Approval rate per language
- [ ] Most visited language versions
- [ ] Translation key coverage per page
- [ ] AI translation success rate
- [ ] User language preference distribution

Query for monitoring:
```sql
-- Translation coverage by language
SELECT 
  l.code, 
  l.native_name,
  COUNT(t.id) as total_translations,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN t.approved THEN 1 END) as approved_count,
  ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN t.approved THEN 1 END)::numeric / NULLIF(COUNT(t.id), 0) * 100, 2) as approval_percentage
FROM languages l
LEFT JOIN translations t ON l.code = t.language_code
WHERE l.enabled = true
GROUP BY l.code, l.native_name
ORDER BY l.sort_order;
```

## üéØ Next Steps

Future enhancements to consider:

- [ ] Automatic language detection from user location
- [ ] Translation memory for consistency
- [ ] Glossary management for technical terms
- [ ] Translation export/import (CSV, JSON)
- [ ] Translation versioning and rollback
- [ ] A/B testing different translations
- [ ] Professional translator collaboration tools
- [ ] Translation quality scoring
- [ ] Automated translation suggestions
- [ ] SEO optimization per language

## ‚ú® Success Criteria

The i18n system is successfully implemented when:

1. ‚úÖ Users can switch languages seamlessly
2. ‚úÖ All content appears in the selected language
3. ‚úÖ URLs reflect the current language
4. ‚úÖ Language preference persists across sessions
5. ‚úÖ New translations can be added easily
6. ‚úÖ AI translation works reliably
7. ‚úÖ Translation management is intuitive
8. ‚úÖ No broken links when switching languages
9. ‚úÖ Performance is not impacted
10. ‚úÖ System is well-documented

## üìù Notes

- This implementation uses i18next with Supabase backend
- Translations are stored in the database, not in static files
- Real-time updates ensure content is always fresh
- AI translation uses Lovable AI (Google Gemini 2.5 Flash)
- System supports 16 languages out of the box
- RTL languages are supported (set `rtl = true` in languages table)
