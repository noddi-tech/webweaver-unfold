## Pre-Launch Verification

### Test Your System (5 Minutes)

**1. Check Language Switcher** (Current page: `/en/`)
- Go to the header - you should see a language selector
- Try switching to another language (e.g., German `/de/`)
- Verify the URL changes to `/de/`
- Check if content is in English (normal - no translations yet)

**2. Check Translation Manager**
- Navigate to: `/cms/translations`
- You should see 455+ English translation keys
- Check the "Translation Stats" section
- Verify languages show in the tabs

**3. Check Language Settings**
- In CMS, go to Language Settings
- Verify enabled languages are listed
- Check that language switcher options are enabled

**4. Quick Browser Test**
```
Visit: /en/
Visit: /de/
Visit: /fr/
Visit: /it/
```
All should load without errors (showing English text is expected until translation)

## Go-Live Steps

### Step 1: Run AI Translation (5 minutes)

1. **Navigate to Translation Manager**
   ```
   URL: /cms/translations
   ```

2. **Click "AI Translate All Languages"**
   - This will translate all 455+ English keys
   - Into all enabled languages (currently 16)
   - Takes 2-5 minutes to complete

3. **Expected Result**
   ```
   âœ… German (de): 455 translations created
   âœ… French (fr): 455 translations created
   âœ… Italian (it): 455 translations created
   âœ… Spanish (es): 455 translations created
   ... (for all enabled languages)
   ```

### Step 2: Review Translations (30-60 minutes)

1. **Select a language tab** (e.g., "German")
2. **Review key translations**:
   - Homepage hero title
   - Main navigation items
   - CTA buttons
   - Feature descriptions
3. **Edit if needed** (click in text area)
4. **Approve good translations** (âœ“ button)

**Priority review areas**:
- Homepage (most visible)
- Pricing page (business critical)
- Navigation & CTAs (user experience)

### Step 3: Enable Languages (5 minutes)

1. **Start with 1-2 languages** (recommended: German, French)
2. **Go to Language Settings**
3. **Toggle "Enabled" for reviewed languages**
4. **Save changes**

### Step 4: Test Live (15 minutes)

**For each enabled language**:
- Visit homepage: `/de/`, `/fr/`
- Check text is translated
- Verify language switcher works
- Test navigation (all links work)
- Try on mobile device
- Check for layout issues

### Step 5: Monitor (Ongoing)

**First Week**:
- Check error logs daily
- Monitor language usage in analytics
- Collect user feedback
- Fix any reported issues

**First Month**:
- Review translation quality
- Add more languages
- Optimize based on usage
- Professional review for key markets

UPDATE language_settings
SET enable_browser_detection = false,
    default_language_code = 'en';
```
