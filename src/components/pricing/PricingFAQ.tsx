      question: "Why revenue-based pricing?",
      answer: "Revenue-based pricing ensures you pay in proportion to the value you get. As your business grows and generates more revenue, your costs scale with youâ€”but your effective rate decreases. This model aligns our success with yours."
    },
    {
      question: "How are rates calculated?",
      answer: "Rates are calculated using a tiered system across 10 revenue ranges. Each tier has a specific take-rate that applies to revenue within that range. As you move into higher tiers, your take-rate decreases by approximately 20% per tier, resulting in continuously decreasing effective rates."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you offer discounts?",
      answer: "Yes! We offer two types of contract discounts: 15% off with a monthly contract, and 25% off with a yearly contract. These discounts apply to your entire usage cost, providing significant savings."
    },
    {
      question: "Is there a minimum commitment?",
      answer: "No minimum commitment is required for the standard pay-as-you-go model. Monthly and yearly contracts offer discounts but come with their respective commitment periods. You can cancel anytime with appropriate notice."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if my revenue changes?",
      answer: "Your pricing automatically adjusts as your revenue changes. If your revenue increases, you'll move into higher tiers with lower take-rates. If it decreases, your costs adjust proportionally. This ensures you always pay a fair rate."
    },
    {
      question: "Are there any hidden fees?",
      answer: "No hidden fees whatsoever. The usage fee includes everything: platform access, AI features, customer support, updates, and maintenance. There are no separate SaaS licence fees, no seat fees, and no surprise charges."
